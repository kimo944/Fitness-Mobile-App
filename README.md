The fitness mobile application aims to Provide users with real-time exercise tracking and feedback to ensure correct form and technique. Offer personalized fitness calculations, nutrition tracking, and activity monitoring for users to make informed decisions about their health and fitness. Facilitate seamless communication with gym coaches.

key components and features:

1.	User Authentication: Users would need to sign in to the app using a valid email and password and provide a username.

2.	Exercise Tracking with AI: The app would utilize the camera to track user exercises and provide real-time feedback on their form. It could count repetitions and notify users if they are performing exercises incorrectly, allowing them to correct their technique.

3.	Fitness Calculations: Users would enter personal information such as age, weight, height, etc., which the app would then use to calculate various fitness metrics, including calories, BMI, body fat percentage, BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate), ideal weight, TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure), and more.

4.	Food Tracking: The app would provide a food menu from which users can select the food they eat and specify quantities. This feature would help users track their nutritional intake and monitor their calorie consumption.

5.	Activity Tracking: Users would be able to select activities from a menu and specify the duration of each activity. This functionality would enable users to monitor their physical activities and track their energy expenditure.

6.	Coach-User Communication: The app would facilitate communication between users and their gym coaches. Users could send messages to their coaches, ask fitness-related questions, and seek professional guidance.

7.	Automated Results Sharing: The app would automatically send users' fitness calculation results to their subscribed coaches. This feature would allow coaches to monitor their clients' progress and stay updated on their health and fitness metrics.

8.	Messaging and Data Storage: All user-coach messages and user information would be stored securely on a Firebase database. Only the admin would have access to this information.

9.	AI-Powered Competitions: The app could incorporate AI features to track users' exercise performance and organize competitions. Users could participate in challenges to complete the highest number of specific exercises within a week or a month, fostering motivation and healthy competition.

the primary objectives of the app:


1.	Exercise Tracking and Guidance: The app aims to track users' exercises using AI technology and provide real-time feedback to ensure they perform the exercises correctly. By offering guidance on proper form and technique, the app helps users reduce the risk of injury and maximize the effectiveness of their workouts.

2.	Personalized Fitness Calculations: The app aims to provide users with personalized fitness calculations based on their individual information such as age, weight, height, etc. By calculating metrics like calories, BMI, body fat percentage, BMR, ideal weight, and TDEE, the app empowers users with insights into their fitness levels and helps them set realistic goals.

3.	Nutrition Tracking and Monitoring: The app aims to assist users in tracking their nutrition by providing a food menu and allowing them to select the foods they consume. By monitoring their calorie intake and nutritional choices, users can make informed decisions about their diet and maintain a balanced approach to nutrition.

4.	Activity Tracking and Energy Expenditure: The app aims to enable users to track their physical activities and measure energy expenditure. By selecting activities from a menu and specifying durations, users can monitor their progress, set targets, and stay motivated to lead an active lifestyle.

5.	Seamless Communication with Coaches: The app aims to facilitate seamless communication between users and their gym coaches. By enabling users to message their coaches, ask questions, and seek professional advice, the app fosters a supportive environment and enhances the coaching experience.

6.	Automated Data Sharing for Coach Monitoring: The app aims to automate the process of sharing users' fitness calculation results with their subscribed coaches. This feature allows coaches to monitor their clients' progress, provide personalized recommendations, and ensure timely interventions if necessary.

7.	Motivation through Competitions: The app aims to motivate users by incorporating AI-powered competitions. By organizing challenges based on specific exercises, users can compete with others and strive to achieve the highest number of repetitions within a given time frame. This feature promotes engagement, healthy competition, and continuous improvement.

#  TensorFlow Lite model on Android

TensorFlow Lite is a mobile library for deploying models on mobile, microcontrollers and other edge devices.


Due to the rapid development of deep convolutional neural networks, human pose estimation has significant performance improvement, this helps to accurately analyze the exercise the user is performing.

Human pose estimation localizes body key points to accurately recognize the postures of individuals given in images or video. 

This step is a crucial prerequisite for the workout analysis. 
I describe a method of detecting a user's body posture during a workout, and comparing their body posture to a professional reference workout, for aiding in resolving this problem. 
Based on the latest advancement in deep learning for human body pose estimation, we represent the human body as a collection of limbs and calculate angles between them to detect errors and provide accuracy to the user. 


With Human Pose Estimation (HPE), we can achieve just that.
Leveraging the power of machine learning (ML) and computer vision, we can accurately estimate the positions of body joints, such as shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles.



 TensorFlow Lite models, you can use Firebase ML to deploy your models. By deploying models with Firebase, you can reduce the initial download size of your app and update your app's ML models without releasing a new version of your app. And, with Remote Config and A/B Testing, you can dynamically serve different models to different sets of users.
